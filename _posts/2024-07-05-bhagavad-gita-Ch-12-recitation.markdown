> Full Chapter 12 Bhagavad Gita Recitation by Aryan in one go (video is unedited, except just to add captions and meaning of verses).
> There are 4 ways of meditation. You can meditate on Swans (Breath/Prana), Shabda (Vibration/Mantra), Swaroop (Form) and Niraakaar (Avyakta/ब्रह्म /Formless).
> We will talk about them some other day. But 2 popular methods are meditating on "Form" or "Formless". A Sadhaka (Yogi/Seeker) may ask "should I meditate on form or on formless?"
> Short answer:  Sri Krishna says both are good. It may just be an easier option to meditate on 'Form' for most people. 
> Let's listen to dialog between Sri Krishna & Arjuna

> Namo namah!
